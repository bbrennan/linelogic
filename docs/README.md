# Documentation Index

LineLogic documentation lives under `docs/` and is organized for discoverability.

## Where things live
- **Specs**: `docs/specs/` — technical specs, how-tos, deployment/training guides
- **Decisions (ADRs)**: `docs/decisions/` — architectural decisions and templates
- **Research**: `docs/research/` — background research, links, surveys
- **Status**: `docs/status/` — dated status notes, test logs, iteration logs
- **Archive**: `docs/archive/` — obsolete or superseded docs kept for history

## Start here
- Roadmap and implementation plan: `docs/specs/roadmap/`
- Deployment + operations: `docs/specs/deployment/`
- Model training: `docs/specs/training/`
- MLOps: `docs/specs/mlops/`

## Conventions
- New documentation should not be added to the repo root.
- Add new docs under the appropriate `docs/` subfolder.
- Dated notes (logs, checklists, snapshots) belong in `docs/status/`.
