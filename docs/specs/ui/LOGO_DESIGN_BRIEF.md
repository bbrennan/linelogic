## Brand Personality

| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Precise** | Mathematical, data-driven, rigorous—like a Bloomberg Terminal |
| **Sharp** | Intelligent, analytical, confident—for serious bettors |
| **Professional** | Research-grade tool, not a weekend app |
| **Transparent** | Open methodology, peer-reviewable |

**Brand Essence:** *"Finding the edge through mathematical precision"*

## Logo Concept: "The Edge"

### Primary Concept (Recommended)

**Concept Name:** "The Edge"  
**Visual Metaphor:** Probability distribution intersecting with decision threshold

```
     ╱╲ 
    ╱  ╲  LINE
   ╱    ╲ LOGIC
  ╱──────╲
          ◢
```

**Description:**
- **Geometric shape**: Triangle or ascending line representing probability curve
- **Intersection point**: Where predicted probability crosses threshold (the "edge")
- **Clean lines**: Single-weight, minimalist, scalable
- **Orientation**: Ascending/upward to convey positive momentum

**Why this works:**
- Conveys "finding the edge" visually
- Mathematical aesthetic (graphs, distributions)
- Simple enough to work at 16px (favicon) and billboard scale
- Memorable and distinctive

---

### Alternative Concept A: "The Distribution"

**Visual Metaphor:** Bell curve (normal distribution) with median marker

```
    ▁▃▅▇█▇▅▃▁
  ──────╫──────
   LINELOGIC
```

**Description:**
- Histogram-style bell curve
- Vertical line marking median/decision point
- Data visualization aesthetic

**Why this works:**
- Instantly recognizable to quantitative audience
- Conveys statistical rigor
- Unique in sports betting space

---

### Alternative Concept B: "The Grid"

**Visual Metaphor:** Analytical framework, precision measurement

```
  ╔═══╗
  ║ ▌ ║  LINELOGIC
  ╚═══╝
  ├───┤
```

**Description:**
- Grid/blueprint aesthetic
- Technical precision
- Structured analysis

**Why this works:**
- Professional, engineering-like
- Conveys systematic approach
- Clean and modern
